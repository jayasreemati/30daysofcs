# Array
1.Arrays are collections of elements stored in contiguous memory.
2.They have a fixed size and store elements of the same type.
3.Elements are accessed by index, allowing for random access.
4.Common operations include insertion, deletion, and traversal, but resizing is typically inefficient.

# Stack
1.A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates where you can only add or remove the top plate.
2.Stacks support two primary operations:
Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes the top element from the stack.
3.Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists
4.Applications: Used in function call management, backtracking, expression evaluation, and undo mechanisms.

# Heap
1.Definition: Heap is a tree-based data structure satisfying max or min property.
2.Representation: Often implemented as binary trees, ensuring completeness.
3.Operations: Key operations include insertion, extraction, and heapify.
4.Applications: Used in priority queues, sorting algorithms, and graph algorithms like Dijkstra's and Prim's.
