Five types of selectors:
1.Type selectors
2.Class selectors
3.ID selectors
4.Universal selectors
5.Combining selectors

1.Type selectors - Its gonna select all elements of type heading1

2.Class selectors - class selectors allow us to assign styles to elements that contain a specific class or set of classes.
—> So this class selector is noted with a dot followed by the class name,its used to style multipele elements that have that class name.

Ex :
.title{
color : red ;
}

—>Here we are styling all elements that have a class of title and we are changing the color to red.
—>In this casew,its just the heading one.

3.ID selectors - ID selectors allow you to assign styles to one element containing a specific ID.

Ex :
title {
color : red ;
}

—>so its noted with a hash symbol and its followed by the ID name.
—>And again ,use the style one element with the ID name.
—>so instead of class of title on our heading level one, we’ve got an ID of title setting color to red.

4.Universal selector - This is noted with an asterisk and it matches any element.

Ex :
html:
Hello
This is a link to a cool
website.

CSS:
*{
color : red ;
}

so all the h1 and paragraph will be in red color.
—> So to make every single element red,we could write asterisk and then in the curly brackets color red.

5.combining Selectors - You can combine selectors to be more specific about which element you want to select.

Ex :
.body p {
color : blue;
}

All the paragraphs inside a body are colored blue.

.body p#blue{
color : blue ;
}
Here it would color all the paragraph elements with an ID blue inside of a tag with a class element body.
