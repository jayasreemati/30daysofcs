​
1. First brower displays document,it has to combine content with style information.
2. Browser load HTML, and convert HTML to DOM(Document Object Model -->It is a representation of the objects that really makeup the structure and content of the document.)
3.  Later fetches the linked resources like images,videos,CSS.
4.  Parses the CSS ,It is gonna decide style rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM and gonna associate styles to them,this is render tree.
5. Render tree is laid out in the structure and should appear after all the style rules have been applied.

ELEMENTS:-
-->Elements are the basis of document structure.
-->CSS depends on the elements And take two forms.
1. Replaced Elements -- Elements where the content is replaced by something not directly represented in the document content.
2. Non-replaced Elements -- Elements where the content is presented by the user agent(browser) inside a box generated by the element itself.
ex. <h1>Hello</h1>
Hello
​
BLOCK ELEMENTS :- 
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available. 
ex. <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is important</P>  These both lines are block elements
​
INLINE ELEMENTS:-
An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary.
ex. <p>This is a<a href ="#"> link </a>to a cool website</p>
​
